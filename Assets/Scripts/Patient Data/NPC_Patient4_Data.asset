  recommendations: With high suspicion of testicular torsion, immediate urological
    consultation with emergency surgery is suggested, followed with pain relief.
    If surgical intervention is unable to occur manual detorsion is to be attended.
    Ultrasound of the area is to be attended with a urinalysis, full blood count,
    c-reactive protein plus Scintigraphy to occur.
  patienthospitaljourney: Nathan was sent for an urgent ultrasound with a Scintigraphy
    which showed a torsion of the right teste. He was rushed to the operating theatre
    where the Urologist performed a scrotal exploration and untwisted his teste.
    He was sent to the ward and was discharged on day three post op. It was not known
    how he got his torsion and the Urologist managed to save his right teste.
  clinicalReferences: 'Testicular torsion can clinically look like other surgical
    and non-surgical diagnosis, males that present similarly should be screen adequately
